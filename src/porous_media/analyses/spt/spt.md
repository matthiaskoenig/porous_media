# TODO SPT results

## Analysis
- necrosis pattern plot (with correct area, volume correction)
- distributions over time (protein, S, P, T), boxplot/violinplot
- position dependent boxplot (S, P, T, necrosis); single/multiple timepoints

## 2D Geometry visualization
- videos (all simulations)
- snapshots of selected timepoints (all simulations)
- zonation pattern plot
