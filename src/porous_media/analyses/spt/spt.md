# TODO SPT results

## Model updates
- [ ] uncouple toxic compound from product; i.e. only a subset of the product results in 
      toxicity (better decoupling)
- [ ] use switch-like behavior for model;

## Analysis
- [x] distributions over time (protein, S, P, T)
  - [ ] boxplot/violinplot
- [ ] position dependent boxplot (S, P, T, necrosis); single/multiple timepoints


## 2D Geometry visualization
- videos (all simulations)
- snapshots of selected timepoints (all simulations)
- zonation pattern plot
