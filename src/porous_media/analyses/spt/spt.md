# TODO SPT results

## Analysis
- [ ] distributions over time (protein, S, P, T), boxplot/violinplot (split by pattern)
- [ ] position dependent boxplot (S, P, T, necrosis); single/multiple timepoints


## 2D Geometry visualization
- videos (all simulations)
- snapshots of selected timepoints (all simulations)
- zonation pattern plot
