# Analysis
- [ ] FIXME: calculate volume from geometry and add to the elements (compare to given volume); calculated cell data
- [ ] FIXME: calculate perfusion with vector data and geometry; visualization of perfusion

- [ ] FIXME: visualize vector data: fluid-flux: vector field & streamlines
- [ ] FIXME: better combination of panels into figure; i.e. title and colorbar only on selected panels (i.e. different variants of the panels)

- [ ] FIXME: add calculated point and cell data to simulation; I.e. definition of formulas
      such as unit conversions [Pa] -> [mmHg];
      This should happen as early as possible, probably already when generating the XDMF. Additional data
      could also be injected later on.


# Mesh generation
- [ ] Histology image with staining; mesh generation from image (spatialPCA)
  - [ ] Create numpy array with data from image
