# Analysis

- [ ] FIXME: visualize point_data: pressure
- [ ] FIXME: visualize vector data: fluid-flux: vector field & streamlines


- [ ] FIXME: order of selections is incorrect
- [ ] FIXME: calculate volume from geometry and add to the elements (compare to given volume)
- [ ] FIXME: visualization of lineplots:
  - [ ] necrosis_fraction ~ time
  - [ ] necrosis_fraction ~ position (video); histogram

- [ ] FIXME: calculate perfusion with vector data and geometry
- [ ] Create images/code for spatial analysis (position ~ values) -> create zonated mesh;


# Mesh generation
- [ ] Histology image with staining; mesh generation from image
  - [ ] Create numpy array with data from image
