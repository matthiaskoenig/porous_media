# Analysis
- [ ] Create images/code for spatial analysis (position ~ values) -> create zonated mesh; 
- FIXME: some variables are not accessible, e.g. pressure variable
- FIXME: calculate volume from geometry and add to the elements
- FIXME: calculate areas?


- FIXME: calculate perfusion:
- cell_type; periportal & perivenous

Diffusion:
D_glc = 600 µm^2/s
D_lac = 700 µm^2/s
D_o2 = 2000 µm^2/s
D_S = 440 µm^2/s

Diffusion coeffiencts: 



# Mesh generation
- [ ] Histology image with staining; mesh generation from image
  - [ ] Create numpy array with data from image
