# Agent-based modelling 
Ralph MÃ¼ller - Aging and osteoporosis
- Lifespan vs health span; life span increased, but health span not; i.e. ~60 years

bone forming and architecture remodeling
- bone forming cells (osteoblasts)
- bone resorbing cells (osteocytes)
- mechanosensitive cells

interplay is called "remodeling"
-> allows adaptation to new load condition
-> renewal of old bone materials

- bone loss attributed to the decrease in mechanical usage
- mechanical loading results in enhanced bone formation
=> prevention of bone fractures

Failure mechanisms at the tissue level; concavity and convexity are important

- high resolution micro-CT; loadinng changes; 

agent based updates; cells & cytokine updates ~ 40 minutes;
micro MPA
Loading dependent properties ???

normalized mechanical signalling?

# Taiji Adachi
locale forces; simulation of flow mechanics interaction

# Brigham
pulmonary hypertension is a severe cadiovascular disease
-> changes right ventricle

use shape analysis from imaging data to estimate mechanical properties; 
-> inverse problem

Objective function based on shape
- gradient based optimization is used to efficiently estimate the p that minimizes J
- adjoint method for gradient calculation

Distance between shapes of objects can be measured as a modified Haussdorff distance between the two boundaries

# Wolfgang Wall
Efficient Baysian approaches
- different uncertainties
- aleatory and epist (inherent)
- all problems show spatio-temportal uncertainties
- but high computational costs (complex models)
- high stochastic input dimensions (random fields)
- Lack of HF model gradients/adjoints; 

- high fidality model and Baysian low fidelity model
- BMFIA
- uncertainty propagation depending on parameters


# Global and local strain properties 
- orientation analysis of fibres ! polar plots! orientations of lobuli
- How did you create the actual mesh from the image data?
