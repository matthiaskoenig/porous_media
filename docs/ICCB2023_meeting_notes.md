# Agent-based modelling 
Ralph MÃ¼ller - Aging and osteoporosis
- Lifespan vs health span; life span increased, but health span not; i.e. ~60 years

bone forming and architecture remodeling
- bone forming cells (osteoblasts)
- bone resorbing cells (osteocytes)
- mechanosensitive cells

interplay is called "remodeling"
-> allows adaptation to new load condition
-> renewal of old bone materials

- bone loss attributed to the decrease in mechanical usage
- mechanical loading results in enhanced bone formation
=> prevention of bone fractures

Failure mechanisms at the tissue level; concavity and convexity are important

- high resolution micro-CT; loadinng changes;
