## meshio

There are various mesh formats available for representing unstructured meshes. meshio can read and write all of the following and smoothly converts between them

## Gmsh 
A three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities

PyMesh is a rapid prototyping platform focused on geometry processing. It provides a set of common mesh processing functionalities and interfaces with a number of state-of-the-art open source packages to combine their power seamlessly under a single developing environment.

 I suggest using a dedicated vtk library, either bare vtk, the higher-level mayavi.mlab or my recently acquired favourite, pyvista. I'll elaborate on all this in detail.

## pyvista

PyVista is:

- Pythonic VTK: a high-level API to the Visualization Toolkit (VTK)
- mesh data structures and filtering methods for spatial datasets
- 3D plotting made simple and built for large/complex data geometries
